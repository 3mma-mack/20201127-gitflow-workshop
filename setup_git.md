# Setup: installing git

[Here's](https://git-scm.com/downloads) a great resource for how to download and install `git` on your machine!

It has options for different operating systems: 
 - [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
 - [Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
 - [Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

Once you've downloaded and run the installer file or run the command, you should be good to go!

Git often installs a commandline and GUI (Graphical User Interface) version on Windows. 

You can use either commandline or a GUI to interact with git, but I prefer the commandline, because I don't have to learn anything 'extra' to use it on computer clusters or storage systems etc.
