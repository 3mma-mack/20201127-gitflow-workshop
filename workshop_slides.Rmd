## HOW TO USE THIS 

This is a template slideshow created in R Markdown with ioslides. To generate the .html slides, knit it in Rstudio. 

Should work. Hopefully!

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

\#ItsMySlideshowAndIllDoWhatIWant

# Workshop format: 

1 hour, zoom

slides: html markdown in a repo!

Maybe record it (or parts of it, such as workflow chat) for future reference?

Avoiding breakout rooms for the task, since it's not likely to be a huge group.

# Outline: 

## Outline: 

* 15min intro (FLIC) 
* 10-15min start task! Keep it very simple. (FLIC) 
* 10min issue tickets & tagging them & stuff (FLIC) 
* 10min branching! tying into how the lab website works (SAM) 
* last 10 mins or so: troubleshooting: (SAM) 
* (any time left?) Questions?

## Intro

* 15min intro (FLIC) 
  - git vs github
  - uses, benefits
  - describe the workflow
  - "when do you push to your own repo vs someone else's?"
  - and "when/how do you pull request", 
  - and "what kinda thing should you put in the commit message?"
  - including walking through the task steps

## Task

* 10-15min start task! Keep it very simple. (FLIC) 
 Task: "Add your favourite paper & 1-line summary to a blog post on the lab website" - shows basics of fork/branch/change/PR etc
  - We will knock up a framework blog post 
  - people have to fork the blog post 
  - then make 'issue branch'
  - then edit the blog post to include their favourite paper they've read lately & how it relates to / informs their work 
  - then make pull request
  - we then accept & merge to 'staging' branch
  - check & discuss the blog post.
  - any fixes required? (make issue tickets, lead on to next session)

## Issue Tickets 

* 10min issue tickets & tagging them & stuff (FLIC) 
  - slide with "when to make an issue ticket?"
  - " 1 ticket, or two?" - how to decide where 1 issue stops and another begins?
  - tagging folks in
  - labels
  - ?'kanban'? <- probably a step too far, ignore this!

## Branching & Forks

* 10min branching! tying into how the lab website works (SAM) 
  - how & why to do branches
  - how & why to check which branch you're in
  - why does the lab website have a 'staging' branch? what's this master branch thing all about? 
  - why do we fork the website?
  - issue-focussed branches (e.g. if issue created in task)
  - + 1 slide on how to workflow for a paper (Sam & Jamie's experiences)

## Troubleshooting

* last 10 mins or so: troubleshooting: (SAM) 
  - what to do if it goes wrong? (can skip talking about some of this if we run out of time but want it on slides at least)
  - what if you're working in the wrong branch??!?
  - what to do if you want to push fewer changes than you committed?
  - how to revert if things go wrong? 
  - git cherrypicking?
  - use of git stash
  - here's some additional resources
  ? Recorded walkthrough of here are some useful commands 

## Questions

* (any time left?) Questions?
  - if any additional practical Qs, could set up a work-through-it time?
  - if any conceptual questions etc, try and answer in time left.

## Pre-workshop prep: 

Ask people: 

* Does everyone have git things set up on their comps? 
* Does everyone have a github account?
* What are folks' usernames?
* Do I need to have a setup drop-in? What time would suit?

* Have anyone who can't attend's favourite paper suggestions & summary info ready in the draft blogpost as an example & keep them included.

* Pull together info on how to install git, basic github features, ?how to navigate the lab website repo?
* Send out this info.
