This is a `.html` presentation created in `R Markdown` with `ioslides`. 

(It's been written in a [.Rmd](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) file, and we generated .html slides by 'knitting' it in Rstudio.)

You can check out the code used to make these slides at the [Workshop repo](https://github.com/FlicAnderson/20201127-gitflow-workshop) on Github, and adapt it for your own presentations if you like - we've got a MIT Licence on the repo, which means:

# Intro:

## Git

**Git** is a *version control system*. 

* It doesn't copy your files, as much as keep track of all `changes` ever since you told git to `add` the file to its logs
* Best for `text` files; can't see 'into' binaries (e.g. pdfs, pics)
* Saves the changes you tell it to `commit` to its log in project-specific folders referred to as a repository, or `repo`
* Very useful: undo/redo, backups, switching computers, safely 'experimenting'

It can be used via *Command Line* (the terminal!) or via a *Graphical User Interface* (GUI), on pretty much all systems.

## GitHub

**GitHub** is an *online platform* for storing your git repository. There are others (e.g. GitLab, Bitbucket).

* Keep track of all your repos online - `public` or `private`
* You can tell git to `push` its list of your file changes up to GitHub.
* Or `pull` changes down (yours or someone else's!) and `merge` them with your local copies. 
* Contribute to others' work via a `pull request` 

## Git Workflow

Include a picture

## How To Write A Good Commit Message

`git commit -m "..."`

Be consise & consistent!

* WHAT did you do (e.g. fix, rework, add, update)
* WHERE (e.g. filename, function name, section of paper, variable)

`git commit -m "add Flic's favourite paper to '2020-11-26-favourite-papers.md'"`


## How/When To Pull Request

Fork, Clone, Branch, Edit, Add, Commit, Push, Pull Request

## Favourite Papers Task

**Task:** "Add your favourite paper & 1-line summary to a blog post on the lab website"

**Aim:** practise the basics of fork/branch/change/PR et & make an interesting blog post!

The [Wallace lab website](https://ewallace.github.io/) is built from a github repository, and uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to build the website HTML/CSS from the files in a GitHub repository & hosts them online.

Our task is to add favourite-paper info to the blog post file using the git workflow so we can publish it to the website.

## Flic's Task Setup | *Fork, Clone, Branch, Edit, Add, Commit, Push, Pull Request*

* `forked` (made a copy of) Edward's website repo on GitHub 
* `cloned` the forked repository (downloaded the github copy to my local computer)
* made a `branch` for my changes called "workshop-blogpost"
* created and `edited` a blog post file: "blog/_posts/2020-11-26-favourite-papers.md"
* `added` this file to my 'staging area' locally
* written a `commit` message to explain my changes
* `pushed` my changes up to my copy of the repo on GitHub
* (no `pull request` yet, we're ready to collaborate!)

# Hang On A Minute!

## Are You Already Forked?

If you already have a fork of the lab website, there's an extra step to make sure you've got the latest changes in Edward's original repo!

I made a helpsheet!

## New To Forking?

Fear not! There's a first time for all of us.

Here's how to get started!

# Favourite Papers Task

## Favourite Papers Steps | *Fork, Clone, Branch, Edit, Add, Commit, Push, Pull Request*

* fork the website in github (it copies all branches)
* make branch (e.g."sams-favourite-paper")
* make edits to "blog/_posts/2020-11-26-favourite-papers.md"
* git add blog file
* git commit blog file with helpful message
* git push to your github (to remote)
* check on github the changes are there
* make pull request to Edward's repo (check it's "staging" branch)

## Favourite Papers Steps | *Fork, Clone, Branch, Edit, Add, Commit, Push, Pull Request*

## Favourite Papers Next Steps | *Check Pull Request & Merge*

Edward checks the blog post & merges the changes to `master` branch
 ...publishing the blogpost!

## Issue Tickets 

* GitHub tool: create 'issues' within a repo, where you can add notes.
* markdown format - can include code snippets, formatting, links, emojis!
* @-tag in other GitHub users ("@FlicAnderson, do you get this 404 error before?")
* assign labels to issues like "help wanted", "bug", "question". 
* link issues with pull requests, or keep them separate. 
* once the issue is solved, you can mark it as closed!

## How To Write A Good Issue Ticket

*Give a clear and concise description of the problem or new feature to help others get up to speed quickly*

* how you found the issue & what you've done already to try fix/investigate it/ideas
* tag in colleagues who might offer insights, or answer any questions
* remember to update the issue regularly as progress happens!  
* link to other issues in that repo using the hashtag & issue number e.g. `#42`
* add Add the most useful labels / create your own
* check with people before randomly assigning them issues! :)

## Branching & Forks

* 10min branching! tying into how the lab website works (SAM) 
  - how & why to do branches
  - how & why to check which branch you're in
  - why does the lab website have a 'staging' branch? what's this master branch thing all about? 
  - why do we fork the website?
  - issue-focussed branches (e.g. if issue created in task)
  - + 1 slide on how to workflow for a paper (Sam & Jamie's experiences)

## Troubleshooting

* last 10 mins or so: troubleshooting: (SAM) 
  - what to do if it goes wrong? (can skip talking about some of this if we run out of time but want it on slides at least)
  - what if you're working in the wrong branch??!?
  - what to do if you want to push fewer changes than you committed?
  - how to revert if things go wrong? 
  - git cherrypicking?
  - use of git stash
  - here's some additional resources
  ? Recorded walkthrough of here are some useful commands 

## Questions

* (any time left?) Questions?
  - if any additional practical Qs, could set up a work-through-it time?
  - if any conceptual questions etc, try and answer in time left.
